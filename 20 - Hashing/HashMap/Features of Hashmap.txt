IMPORTANT FEATURES

1. To access the value one must know its Key;

2. Hashmap doesn't allow duplicate Keys but allows duplicate values.That means A single Key can't contain more than  1 value 
   but more than 1 key can contain a single value;
   map.put("Akash", 21);   True
   map.put("Akash", 26);   False  --> it will update the value of the key
   map.put("Yash", 21);    True

3. Java Hashmap maintains no order;
